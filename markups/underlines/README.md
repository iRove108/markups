## Underline Detection

The attempt at using Probabilistic Hough Lines to detect underlines can be found in [underlines.py](https://github.com/iRove108/markups/blob/underline-detection/markups/underlines/underlines.py), and the example can be found in the [underline example directory](https://github.com/iRove108/markups/blob/underline-detection/examples/underlined_text/main.py). It may be possible to explore this method more, but currently, it isn't functional.
